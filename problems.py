# print("{}'s Perimeter: {:.2f}{}".format(shape, perimeter, unit).capitalize())
# the P is not a capital in "perimeter"

# prints each dimension like a list

# even if i calculate p, then a, then both, it formats the list as ALL the perimeters first then ALL the areas after

# need to make efficient and make them into functions
